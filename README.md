# Done or Donate

## Set a task for yourself, put some money on the line, and automatically donate to charity if you do not complete it.

Done or Donate is a procrastination slayer. You know all of those chores you have been putting off for weeks? It's time to take care of them!

When putting your own money on the line, you are significantly more likely to complete any task that you set. If you don't, your credit card gets automatically charged, and the money donated to charity.

### Tech details

Done or Donate is a relatively simple application.

Built on Ruby on Rails, it uses a PostgreSQL database, Bootstrap for speedy front-end design, and is currently hosted by Heroku.

Currently the app is not fully functional, but I have a Trello board full of improvements which I intend to continue working on.
